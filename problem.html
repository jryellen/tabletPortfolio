          <p>The harsh reality is that by cutting the crust off that PB&J or tossing the banana with a brown spot you are contributing to the crises of world hunger, climate change, and the exhaustion of natural resources. Okay, while cutting the crust off one sandwich alone may not be the reason the polar ice caps are melting, Americans as a whole waste a whopping 40% of their food. </p>
          <p>A large chunk of food loss or waste comes from overproduction, processing problems, unstable markets, and even weather. However, we too are accountable for wasting food because of label confusion, poor planning, and overbuying. All the while as many of us struggle to use all the food we buy, 12% of American households are food insecure.</p>
